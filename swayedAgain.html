<font face="Latin Modern Mono Light">The slow rhythmic beats from a
music of the last century, playing in its own world of myriad dreams.
The things that we held as sacrosanct seem to whither and weather
with the passing years. Futility of existence bequeaths. There are
only finite thoughts. We delve on the fact that it is an endless saga
but always a recurrent theme. Abstraction is a way of easing out. The
devil lies in the details. Fabrication helps in keeping the purpose
alive. Purpose is a made up thing to make ourselves feel better. The
limitation of our senses will always keep us aloof of the complete
truth. The mind being the master of our actions, we try to control
it. </font>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Latin Modern Mono Light">Mind
controls itself? Brain is the physical thing that encapsulates the
mind. The mind is experienced only through thinking. We think
therefore, we exist. Mind thinks. Mind sways. Mind plays. Mind
repeats. What if the mind were to be trusted with bigger
responsibilities. Our heart doesn’t need mind control. If it were
to be controlled by the mind then, perhaps it would have stopped
beating the moment we became conscious. Mind is such an abstract
entity that understanding it for oneself becomes deceptive. Mind is
deceptive in its very nature. It’s capable of creating things that
aren’t existing in the real world. It has the ability to conjure
past memories and make us feel the exact same emotion again. </font>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Latin Modern Mono Light">Our
mind is our prison. Our thoughts are our delusion. Our past is a trap
and future is elusive. We wonder why we dissociate and flow with our
thoughts. Just the other day, we made a resolution to work towards a
goal. A goal which embraces freedom and independence. Why do we get
swayed away from the work that needs to be put in to reach the goal?
Why is that we value pleasure, comfort and convenience more?  More
often than not, we let our ambient thoughts control our being which
affects our work. Why are we unwilling to put up a fight? A fight
against our own conditioning, thought patterns, behaviour, lethargy
and apathy. </font>
